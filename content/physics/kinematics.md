# Motion in 1D 
In this rendering of motion, you will *never* need to use vector quantities to describe movement due to the scalar nature of all quantities discussed.
## Reference Frames and Displacement
- Any measurement about motion is taken in terms of a *reference frame*.
> [!NOTE]
> **Example:** A train that moves with respect to the ground being held stationary, is not moving with respect to a stationary person inside that train. If a person were to walk, at let's say $5$ km/s toward the back of the train while it moves forward at $80$ km/h, the person is moving at $75$ km/h with respect to the stationary ground.
- In one dimension, only one axis, the $x$-axis of a coordinate plane is used.
- the *net* distance an object has traveled is known as *displacement*
- *total distance* is the overall distance traveled by the object/particle regardless of reference frame or initial/final positions
- change in positions is described using $\Delta x$

## Average Velocity
It is important to note that this equation was derived from the more complicated calculus variant of the velocity equation. There are 2 important terms here.

$$
\text{average speed}=\frac{\text{distance traveled}}{\text{time elapsed}}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
$$
